in progress - not useful right now.

For those of you curious about what it was intended to do.
RegNotifyChangeKeyValue enables applications to monitor keys for modifications.
This offers the potential to communicate via the registry with a command prompt.

Unfortunately, it isn't possible to be notified of changes on a remote machine
but I still believe this has a future for something...just unsure what exactly.
